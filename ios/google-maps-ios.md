# Google Maps

To add a `Home` label, you first need to turn on web activity tracking, after adding the label, you can then turn off web activity tracking (and the label will persist), all inside the app.

It seems the `Home` label can also be added by tapping the profile icon in the upper right, then `Offline maps` then the gear icon in the upper right, and choose `Edit home or work`.
