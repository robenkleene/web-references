# Google Sheets

- `⇧␣`: Select row
- `⌃␣`: Select column
- `⌃⌥-`: Delete row (with it selected) (This doesn't always work?)

## Notes

- Use `view -> Freeze` to create a header
- To create a select box, use `Data -> Data Validation` and select "List of Items"
- To clip cells, select "Format > Text wrapping > Clip"
