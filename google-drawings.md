# Google Drawings

- `⎋`: Deselect object

## Text Editing

- `⇥`: Indent list item
- `⇧⇥`: Un-indent list item

## Labeled Lines

- Google Drawings doesn't support adding labels to lines, the best substitute is to add text box in between two lines.
- To connect a line to a box, drag the end of a line to one of the points around a boxes edges.
- To easily select an object for moving, click the object which will start editing its text, then hit `⎋` to stop editing.
- There's no option to resize an object to its text.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- There isn't a keyboard shortcut for inserting a shape easily. It's best to make a shape and then cut and paste it.
