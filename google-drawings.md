# Google Drawings

## Labeled Lines

Google Drawings doesn't support adding labels to lines, the best substitute is to add text box in between two lines.

- `⎋`: Deselect object
- To easily select an object for moving, click the object which will start editing its text, then hit `⎋` to stop editing.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- There isn't a keyboard shortcut for inserting a shape easily. It's best to make a shape and then cut and paste it.
