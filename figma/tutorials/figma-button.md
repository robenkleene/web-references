# Figma Button

1. Create a rounded rectangle
2. Add a text label on top
3. Set horizontal alignment to center
4. Select the rectangle and the text and click the "Align Horizontal Centers" (`⌥H`) and "Align Vertical Centers" (`⌥V`) buttons
5. The text will not appear centered because it will have extra space at the bottom for descenders, nudge the text downward until it's optically centered.
