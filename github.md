# GitHub

- `t`: Quick open file
- `y`: Switch to permanent URL
- `.`: Open current repo in VS Code (this doesn't seem to be working, just change the URL to `github.dev`)

## GitHub Pages

- You can check the status of GitHub pages deployments with the `github-pages` environment links on the right.
