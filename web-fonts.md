# Web Fonts

## All Fonts on a Website

To get a quick list of fonts used by a website:

1. Open the web inspector
2. Switch to the Network tab
3. Select Font along the top

There's no way to identify exactly which weights are being used, the only method that works is to click each font using the `WhatFont` extension in Chrome.

Remember to also take italic versions if they're needed.

## Web vs. Local Fonts

To determine whether a web version of a font is being used or a local version, in the Firefox web inspector, inspect and element then choose the `Fonts` tab, then expand `All Fonts on Page`, web fonts will list a URL.
